# 🧬 Symbiote

> _Your Code. Your Style. Your AI Shadow._

**Symbiote** is an intelligent, adaptive coding assistant that _learns how you code_—and then becomes your snarky, ever-evolving sidekick. It observes, remembers, critiques (sometimes too honestly), and writes code in your _exact_ style, almost like your second brain... if your second brain had better linting skills.

Powered by **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **LLaMA 3.3**, and **Gemini API**, Symbiote builds a personal graph of your habits, quirks, and coding rituals to deliver personalized suggestions, witty corrections, and hauntingly familiar code snippets.
